# ParallelUncertaintyHyperthermia
## Evaluates the influence of uncertainties in the temperature distribution 
<hr />
<p>This is a parallelized version of the <a href='https://github.com/antonioMarchese/SerialUncertaintyHipertermia'><strong>SerialUncertaintyHyperthermia< /strong></ a> repository code, in which it is possible to analyze the influence of uncertainties on experimental parameters in hyperthermia treatment. The parallelization strategy allows many experiments to be performed while keeping a low execution time, thus obtaining better results.
